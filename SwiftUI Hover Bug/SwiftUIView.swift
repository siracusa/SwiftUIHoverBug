struct SwiftUIView : View {
    @State var isHovered : Bool = false

                    Drag the pointer in and out of this square repeatedly. \
                    Donâ€˜t move the pointer more than a few dozen points outside \
                    the square each time.

                    Expected results:

                    The square is red when the pointer is inside it, and gray when it is not.

                    Actual results:

                    The square is SOMETIMES red when the pointer is NOT inside it.

        // WORKAROUND: Setting the background color of the outer group to
        // anything that is not "clear" makes this app work as expected.
        //.background(.blue)
